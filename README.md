**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  When writing programs like the Animal Shelter CRUD Python module in Project One, I focused on using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. I structured my code with clear documentation, consistent formatting, and modular methods (create, read, update, and delete), which made the module reusable and easy to integrate with other projects like the dashboard in Project Two. 
  The advantage of this approach is that I was able to easily reuse the same CRUD module to connect my new dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database without needed to rewrite any database logic. In the future, I could adapt this CRUD Python module for other MongoDB collections, such as managing shelter staff, volunteer records, or veterinary appointment records, simply by modifying small parts of the existing class without starting over. 

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
  When approaching the Grazioso Salvare database and dashboard requirements, I first analyzed the client's needs (filtering rescue dogs by criteria, displaying charts, adding interactive maps) and broke them down into smaller tasks. 
  I followed a design-first approach, sketching the dashboard components before coding them. Compared to previous assignments, this project required me to think more like a software engineer - focusing on modularity, interaction between frontend widgets (the dashbaord view), and backend database queries. In future projects, I would use techniques like early prototyping (building and testing small parts quickly) and client-driven requirements gathering to ensure I build databases that exactly match client expectations. 

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**
  Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing and building tools that automate, optimize, or improve processes.
  Throughout this project, my work would help Graziozo Salvare quickly identify suitable dogs for specialized training, which would save time, reduce errors, and ultimately help save lives during rescue operations. Projects like this show how technology can make a direct, positive impact - providing organizations with better decision-making tools and improving operational efficiency through data-driven applications.
